# Cypress End-to-End Testing - Getting Started Course Resources

This repository contains the [slides](/slides) and [code snapshots](/code) for our [Cypress End-to-End Testing - Getting Started Course](https://acad.link/cypress-e2e).

The [attachments](/attachments) folder contains lecture-specific attachments (i.e., course lectures are linking to those attachments).

## Using the Code Snapshots

The code snapshots are there to help you debug your code and find possible errors in your projects. 

If you can't reproduce the results shown in the course videos, take a look at the provided snapshots and compare that code to yours to detect possible error sources. You can also replace your code with ours (step-by-step and only temporarily) to narrow down the issue.

The folders in the [/code directory](/code) map to the different course sections. Inside the section folders, you find multiple folders (i.e., multiple snapshots per section).
